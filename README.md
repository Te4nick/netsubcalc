# Network/Subnetwork Calculation [netsubcalc]
Small and Slow Proof-of-Concept Python Module for Networks and Subnetworks Values Calculation.

Here, we deny standard **ipaddress** Python library preferring only input and return types of **bool**, **int**, **str**, **list[int]** or **None**.

All functions check input values returning **None** if the format is incorrect. Sorry, but we **don't check input types** because they all have tints!

The purpose of this project is to study algorithms, tests and basic python coding concepts.
